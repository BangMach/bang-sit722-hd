# DevOps Pipeline Implementation Plan for Task10_2D

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a comprehensive DevOps pipeline for the Task10_3HD repository, a microservices e-commerce application deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The solution integrates Jenkins pipelines with OpenTofu for infrastructure as code, while maintaining GitHub integration for triggering. The pipeline includes staging (temporary) and production (persistent) environments with automated testing, deployment, and rollback capabilities.

## Final Progress (October 2025)

ðŸŽ‰ **All Goals Achieved**:
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Fully automated Jenkins pipelines for build, test, security scan, and deployment.
- **Security**: Snyk, Trivy, and Azure Defender integrated for vulnerability scanning in CI/CD.
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and acceptance tests automated and published in CI.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform/OpenTofu and Bicep templates for Azure resources, with remote state management.
- **Monitoring**: Azure Application Insights and Azure Monitor configured for all environments.
- **Auto-scaling**: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and AKS cluster autoscaler enabled for backend services.
- **Production Deployment**: Automated deployment to production AKS on PR merge to main, with health checks and rollback.
- **Secrets Management**: Jenkins Credentials and GitHub Secrets for secure access.
- **Compliance & Best Practices**: Azure Policy, managed identities, and blue-green/canary deployment patterns available.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure as Code Setup (Terraform/OpenTofu)
- âœ… Created and applied Terraform configuration for Azure infrastructure.
- âœ… Azure Resource Group, ACR, AKS, monitoring, and logging resources provisioned.
- âœ… Remote state management and environment-specific variables in place.

### Phase 2: Staging Deployment
- âœ… Jenkins pipeline runs unit/integration tests, builds Docker images, and deploys to AKS staging.
- âœ… Snyk and Trivy security scans integrated.
- âœ… Automated destruction of staging resources after acceptance testing.

### Phase 3: Production Deployment
- âœ… Separate Jenkins pipeline for production deployment.
- âœ… Parallel deployment of all services to AKS.
- âœ… Application Insights and Azure Monitor active for production.
- âœ… HPA and cluster autoscaler configured for dynamic scaling.
- âœ… Rollback and health checks automated.
- âœ… Deployment triggered on PR merge to main branch.

## Technical Details

### Tools and Technologies
- **CI/CD Platform**: Jenkins (fully automated)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Registry**: Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- **Orchestration**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform/OpenTofu, Bicep
- **Secrets Management**: Jenkins Credentials, GitHub Secrets
- **Monitoring**: Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics
- **Security**: Azure Defender, Trivy, Snyk
- **Auto-scaling**: HPA and AKS cluster autoscaler

### Pipeline Structure
- **Workflow 1 (testing branch)**: Test, Build, Scan, Push, Deploy to Staging, Acceptance Test, Destroy.
- **Workflow 2 (main branch)**: Deploy to Production, Monitor, Rollback on failure.

### Best Practices Incorporated
- Secure access with managed identities.
- Declarative infrastructure with Bicep and Terraform.
- Azure Policy for compliance.
- Monitoring and health checks for all deployments.
- Blue-green/canary deployment patterns available.

## Testing Steps

### Unit Testing
- âœ… Automated with pytest for backend, Jest for frontend.

### Integration Testing
- âœ… Automated API and message queue tests in CI.

### Acceptance Testing (Staging)
- âœ… Manual and automated health checks, API and UI validation.

### Production Testing
- âœ… Automated smoke tests post-deployment, Application Insights monitoring, rollback on failure.
